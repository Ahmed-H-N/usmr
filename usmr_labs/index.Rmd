# Course overview {-#chap-overview}

## Course description {-}

Univariate Statistics and Methodology in R (USMR) is a semester long crash-course aimed at providing Masters students in psychology with a competence in standard univariate methodology and analysis using R. Design and analysis are taught under a unifying framework which shows a) how research problems and design should inform which statistical method to use and b) that many statistical methods are special cases of a more general model. This course will introduce you to statistical modelling and empower you with tools to analyse richer data and answer a broader set of research questions of interest to you.

This course introduces you to statistics and R software. We begin with introductions to the use of statistical methods in research and to R for statistics. We then move to learning about inferential statistics, covering concepts such as hypothesis testing, Type I vs. Type II errors, p-values and power. Common tests such as t-tests and chi-squared tests are introduced before building to a thorough explanation of simple linear regression and its application and assumptions. Extending this to multiple regression with interaction terms and categorical coding schemes, the course culminates in introducing the generalised linear model and the different families of models.
