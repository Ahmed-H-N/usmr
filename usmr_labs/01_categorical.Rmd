**Prerequisites**

Please ensure you have successfully installed R and RStudio, or are working on RStudio Cloud, and that you have completed the tasks on the [Getting started in R & RStudio](00_intro.html) page, which introduced the basics of a) how to navigate around Rstudio, b) how to create a Rmarkdown document, c) how to read data into R, and d) how to use R to do basic arithmetic.

# Exercises: Rolling Dice

`r qbegin(1)`
Open Rstudio, and make sure you have your USMR course project open.  

Open a new Rmarkdown document:    
__File > New File > R Markdown..__  

And in your first code-chunk, copy the code from the lecture which creates a custom function called `dice()` (copied below). Be sure to run the code-chunk.  
```{r}
dice <- function(num = 1) {
  sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE)
}
```

Remember, you can add a code-chunk with the "Insert" button in the top right of your Rmarkdown document, and clicking R. Or you can use a shortcut of **Ctrl + Alt + i**.   
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/categorical/freshrmd2.png")
```
`r qend()`

:::frame
### What does the code-chunk do?

In a sense, this code-chunk does *nothing*:  It won't give you any output when you run it.  What it is actually doing, though, is defining a *function* called `dice()`.  If you look at your *environment* panel (top right), you'll see `dice` appear when you run the code.

To produce some output, we have to *call* the function `dice()` (by writing it into code:  `dice(4)`, for example).  `dice()` wants to be supplied with some information (in the *argument* `num`).  If no information is supplied, num will take a *default value* of `1`.  (So writing `dice()` is equivalent to writing `dice(1)`).

What does `dice()` do with `num`?  It calls another function, `sample()`, with *3* arguments.  We didn't write `sample()`:  it's a function that's "supplied with" R.  To find out more about what `sample()` does:

* click inside the brackets just after `sample()` in your RMarkdown document (not this document; the one in RStudio);

* press `TAB` (`â‡¥`), then `F1`

* you should see some help appear in the bottom right-hand panel of RStudio.

You will find that "`sample()` takes a sample ... from the elements of `x` ..."  If you compare the code in RStudio to the code under "Usage" you'll see that where the help has `x`, we have `1:6`.  So what does `1:6` mean?  One way to find out is to open the *console* in RStudio (bottom left) and just type stuff in.  What happens when you type `1:6`?  What about `2:17`?  (What about `6:1`?)

The console is the place to "try stuff out" (don't worry, you can't break it).  What you should have found out is that `1:6` creates a *vector* (list of similar things, in this case numbers) of the numbers 1-6.

Next, `num` maps to `size`: Looking through the help, `size` is the number of items to choose.  So `sample(1:6, 1)` would choose one number from the numbers 1-6 at random; `sample(1:6, 3)` would choose 3, and so on.  The last argument, `replace=TRUE`, tells `sample()` what to do with a number once it's been picked:  Does it go 'back into the bag' to be picked again (`TRUE`) or not? (`FALSE`)?

Putting it all together, our `dice()` function "throws a die `num` times" by `sample()`ing from the numbers 1-6 `num` times, `replace`ing each number when it's been picked.
:::


`r qbegin(2)`
Roll the dice 100 times.  
Store the results in an object in your environment.  
Create a barplot showing the frequency with which each number was landed on in the 100 rolls. 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(2, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
roll100 <- dice(100)
```

We can get the frequency table using `table()`
```{r}
table(roll100)
```
Which we can then pass to the `barplot()` function:
```{r}
barplot(table(roll100))
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(3)`
Do the same for 1000 rolls, and then for 10,000.  
What do you notice?  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(3, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
barplot(table(dice(1000)))

barplot(table(dice(10000)))
```

gets flatter - uniform probability! 
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(4)`
Copy the code below into a code-chunk and run it. 
It creates a new function called `wdice()` which simulates the rolling of a die which is slightly weighted. 

Roll the weighted die 100 times and plot the frequency distribution. Do the same for 1000 and 10,000 rolls.  
Does a pattern emerge? At how many rolls? 

```{r}
wdice <- function(num = 1){
    sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.25))
}
```

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(4, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
barplot(table(wdice(100)))
barplot(table(wdice(1000)))
barplot(table(wdice(10000)))
```

100 rolls is not enough to reliably perceive the weighting of the die. 
1000 is though!

`r solend()`

`r qbegin(5)`
Take another loook at the `wdice()` function. Try modifying it so that 50% of the time it lands on number 6.  
**Hint:** The `prob` bit is what was different from the original `dice()` function, and it looks like it takes a set of probabilities `prob = c(.....)`. Be careful to remember that the probability of these different outcomes must sum to 1 (i.e., it's not possible to land on 6 50% of the time as well as land on 5 60% of the time).  
  
**To test out your modified function, you will need to re-run code which defines the function.**

:::frame
__Think of it as "overwriting", "replacing", or "reassigning"__

```{r}
# define an object called "x" which has the value 3
x <- 3
# print the object x
x 
# reassign the name "x" to the value 5
x <- 5
```

When you use the assignment operator `<-` we assign a name to a value and store in R's memory. To edit any of these things, we simply _reassign_ the name to with the edited value. This applies to functions, to dataframes, and to specific observations in dataframes etc.  
:::
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(5, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
wdice <- function(num = 1){
    sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.5))
}
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(6)`
Can you detect the weighting in your new die (the one which 50% of the time lands on number 6) in only 100 rolls?  

Conceptually, what can we learn from this toy example.  
**Hint:** Think of how strongly weighted the die is as an **effect size**, and the number of rolls as the **sample size**.  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(6, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
barplot(table(wdice(100)))
```

the bigger effect size/difference, the smaller the sample size required to observe it. 

`r solend()` 

# Reading: Accessing Data in R  

Now that we've played with a toy example for a bit, we're going to read in some data, and look at some of the variables 

Let's read some data into R. 
First we'll load the **tidyverse** package, so that we can use the `read_csv()` function.  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
starwars2 <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/starwars2.csv")
```

:::yellow
__Reading data from a URL__ 

Note that when you have a url for some data, such as [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uoepsy/dapr1/master/dapr1_labs/data/starwars2.csv), you can read it in directly by giving functions like `read_csv()` the url inside quotation marks. 
:::

The data contains information on various characteristics of characters from Star Wars.
We can print out the top of the data by using the `head()` function which displays the first six rows of the data by default. You could change this by saying, for example, `head(data, n = 10)`:
```{r}
head(starwars2, n = 10)
```

_(Don't worry about the_ <NA>s _for now, they are just how R tells you an entry is missing, i.e. Not Available.)_  

:::green
__Tip:__ Try clicking on the data in your __environment__ (the top right window of RStudio). It will open the data in a tab in the editor window - this is another way of looking at the data, more like you would in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.
This can be time-consuming if your data file is big.
:::

We can take a look at how big the data is (the dimensions), using `dim()`
```{r}
dim(starwars2)
```

There's a reasonable amount of data in there - `r nrow(starwars2)` rows and `r ncol(starwars2)` columns.  
In the __starwars2__ data, each character is an __observational unit__, and there are 6 __variables__ (things which vary between units) such as their _height_, _species_, _homeworld_, etc.  

:::yellow  
__Units and variables__

The individual entities on which data are collected are called __observational units__ or __cases__. Often (but not always), these equate to the rows of a dataset.  

A __variable__ is any characteristic that varies from observational unit to observational unit (these are often the columns of the dataset)
:::

What if we want to extract certain subsections of our dataset, such as specific observational units or variables? 
This is where we learn about two important bits of R code used to access parts of data - the dollar sign `$`, and the square brackets `[]`.

:::frame
__The dollar sign $__  
  
The dollar sign allows us to extract a specific variable from a dataframe.
For instance, we can pull out the variable named "eye_color" in the data, by using `$eye_color` after the name that we gave our dataframe: 
```{r}
starwars2$eye_color
```
:::

Each variable in a dataframe is a vector (a set of values). Once extracted, we will have a vector and not a dataframe.


:::frame
__The square brackets []__  
  
Square brackets are used to do what is known as __indexing__ (finding specific entries in your data).  
We can retrieve bits of data by identifying the $i^{th}$ entry(s) inside the square brackets, for instance: 

```{r}
# assign the numbers 10, 20 ... 100 to the name "somevalues"
somevalues <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)

# pull out the 3rd entry
somevalues[3]
```

In the above example, we have a __vector__ (a single sequence of values), and so we can retrieve entries with the syntax:
<center> 
**vector[entry]**
</center>
<br>
In a __dataframe__ we have an extra dimension - we have rows _and_ columns. Using square brackets with a dataframe needs us to specify both:  
<center>
**dataframe[rows, columns]**
</center>
:::

Let's look at some examples: 
```{r}
# first row, fourth column:
starwars2[1, 4]

# tenth row, first column:
starwars2[10, 1]
```

<br>

If we leave either rows or columns blank, then we will get out __all__ of them: 
```{r}
# tenth row, all columns:
starwars2[10, ]

# all rows, 2nd column:
starwars2[ , 2]
```

<br>

There are is another way to identify column - we can use the name in quotation marks:
```{r}
# first row, "species" column
starwars2[1, "species"]
```
<br>
Finally, we can also ask for multiple rows, or multiple columns, or both! To do that, we use the combine function `c()`:
```{r}
# the 1st AND the 6th row, 
# and the 1st AND 3rd columns:
starwars2[c(1,6), c(1,3)]
```
<br>
And we can specify a sequence using the colon, `from:to`:  
```{r}
# FROM the 1st TO the 6th row, all columns:
starwars2[1:6, ]
```

Why? Because the colon operator, `from:to`, creates a vector from the value `from` to the value `to` in steps of 1.
```{r}
1:6
```
`r optbegin(label="Extra: Combining $ and []", olabel=FALSE)`
We can use the two accessors in combination: 

```{r}
# extract the variable called "name" and show the 20th entry 
starwars2$name[20]
```

This represents the 20th name in the data.

__Note:__ When we do this, we don't have the comma inside the square brackets.  
When we use the `$` to pull out a variable, such as `starwars2$name`, we no longer have a dataframe - `starwars2$name` doesn't have rows and columns, it just has a series of values - _it's a vector!_.   
So when you are using `[]` with a __vector__ (1 dimension) rather than a __dataframe__ (2 dimensions), you don't specify `[rows, columns]`, but simply `[entry]`. 
`r optend()`


:::yellow
__The dollar sign $__ 

Used to extract a variable from a dataframe:   

+ `dataframe$variable`

__The square brackets []__

Used to extract parts of an R object by identifying rows and/or columns, or more generally, "entries". Left blank will return all. 

+ `vector[entries]`
+ `dataframe[rows, columns]`
:::

## Accessing by a condition {-}  

We can also do something really useful, which is to access all the entries in the data for which _a specific condition_ is true.  

Let's take a simple example to start:
```{r}
somevalues <- c(10, 10, 0, 20, 15, 40, 10, 40, 50, 35)
```

To only select values which are greater than 20, we can use:
```{r}
somevalues[somevalues > 20]
```

Let's unpack what this is doing..  

<div style="margin-left:15px">
First, let's look at what `somevalues > 20` does. It returns TRUE for the entries of `somevalues` which are greater than 20, and FALSE for the entries of `somevalues` that are not (that is, which are less than, or equal to, 20. 

This statement `somevalues > 20` is called the __condition__.    
```{r}
somevalues > 20
```

We can give a name to this sequence of TRUEs and FALSEs
```{r}
condition <- somevalues > 20
condition
```

Now consider putting the sequence of TRUEs and FALSEs inside the square brackets in `somevalues[]`.
This returns only the entries of `somevalues` for which the condition is `TRUE`.  
```{r}
somevalues[condition]
```

So what we can do is use a __condition__ inside the square brackets to return all the values for which that condition is TRUE.

Note that you don't have to always give a name to the condition. This works too:
```{r}
somevalues[somevalues > 20]
```

</div>
<br>
We can extend this same logic to a dataframe.
Let's suppose we want to access all the entries in our Star Wars data who have the value "Droid" in the _species_ variable.
To work out how to do this, we first need a line of code which defines our __condition__ - one which returns `TRUE` for each entry of the _species_ variable which is "Droid", and `FALSE` for those that are not "Droid".  

We can use the dollar sign to pull out the _species_ variable: 
```{r}
starwars2$species
```

And we can ask R whether each value __is equal to__ "Droid" (*Remember:* in R, we ask whether something __is equal to__ something else by using a double-equals, `==`). A single equal sign would be wrong, as it denotes assignment.
```{r}
starwars2$species == "Droid"
```

Finally, we can use this condition inside our square brackets to access the entries of the data for which this condition is TRUE:
```{r}
# I would read the code below as: 

# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$species=="Droid" is TRUE, and give me all the columns."

starwars2[starwars2$species == "Droid", ]
```

`r optbegin('Optional', FALSE)`
A useful function is `with()`. This creates a "container" where the variables of the dataframe are available to R within the `with()` parentheses without the need to use `$`:
```{r}
with(starwars2, starwars2[species == "Droid", ])
```
`r optend()`


## Editing parts of the data  

Now that we've seen a few ways of _accessing_ sections of data, we can learn how to edit them!  

:::yellow
__Data Cleaning__

One of the most common reasons you will need to modify entries in your data is in __data cleaning__. This is the process of identifying incorrect/incomplete/irrelevant data, and replacing/modifying/deleting them.  
:::

### Changing specific entries {-}  

Above, we looked at the subsection of the data where the _species_ variable had the entry "Droid". Some of you may have noticed earlier that we had some data on C3PO. Is he not also a droid? 

<center>
![](images/types_of_data/c3po.png)  
</center>

(Looks pretty Droid-y to me! _disclaimer: I know nothing about Star Wars_ &#128578; )

Just as we saw above how to _access_ specific entries, e.g.: 
```{r}
# 2nd row, all columns
starwars2[2, ]
# 2nd row, 6th column (the "species" column)
starwars2[2,6]
```

We can change these by __assigning them a new value__ (remember the `<-` symbol):
```{r}
# C3PO is a droid, not a human
starwars2[2,6] <- "Droid"

# Look at the 2nd row now -
# the entry in the "species" column has changed:
starwars2[2, ]
```

:::frame
__Think of it as "overwriting", "replacing", or "reassigning"__

We have _replaced_, or _overwritten_, the entry in the 2nd row and 6th column of the data (`starwars2[2,6]`) with the value "Droid". 
:::

### Changing entries via a condition {-}  

We saw above how to access parts of data by means of a __condition__, with code such as:

```{r}
# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and give me all the columns."

# remember, we're asking for all the columns by leaving it blank *after* the 
# comma inside the square brackets: data[rows, columns]
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", ]
```

What if we wanted to modify it so that every character from "Naboo" was actually of species "Nabooian"?  

We can do that in a number of ways, all of which do the same thing - namely, they access parts of the data and assign them the new value "Nabooian".  

Study the lines of code below and their interpretations:  

```{r}
# In the starwars2 data, give the rows for which condition 
# starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and select only the "species" column. 
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", "species"] <- "Nabooian"

# In the starwars2 data, give the rows for which condition 
# starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and select only the 6th column. 
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", 6] <- "Nabooian"

# Extract the species variable from the starwars2 data (it's a vector).
# Pick the entries for which the condition starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE.
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2$species[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo"] <- "Nabooian"
```


### Changing a variable

Another thing we might want to do is change a whole variable (a whole column) in some way.  
The logic is the same, for instance: 
```{r}
starwars2$height <- starwars2$height / 100
```
What we have done above is taking the variable "height" from the dataframe "starwars2", dividing it by 100 via `starwars2$height / 100`, and then assigning the result to the same variable, i.e. we overwrite the column.  

Equally, we _could also have added a new column_ named "height2" with those values if you do not want to overwrite "height":
```{r eval=FALSE}
starwars2$height2 <- starwars2$height / 100
```
This would have left the "height" variable as-is, and created a new one called "height2" which was the values in "height" divided by 100. 


### Removing rows or columns

Lastly, we might want to change the data by removing a row or a column.
Again, the logic remains the same, in that we use `<-` to assign the edited data to a name (either a new name, thus creating a new object, or an existing name, thereby _overwriting_ that object).  
  
For instance, notice that the 35th and 75th rows of our data probably aren't a valid observation - I'm reasonably sure that Marge and Homer Simpson never appeared in Star Wars:
```{r}
starwars2[c(35,75), ]
```

We can remove a certain row(s) by using a minus sign `-` inside the square brackets 
```{r}
# everything minus the 75th row
starwars2[-75, ]

# everything minus the (35th and 75th rows)
starwars2[-c(35, 75), ]
```

And we can simply _re-use_ the name "starwars2" to overwrite the data and make this change take effect (rather than just print out the result, which the code above did):
```{r}
starwars2 <- starwars2[-c(35, 75), ]
```
(now, in the __environment__ pane of Rstudio, the object named "starwars2" will say 73 observations, rather than 75, which it had before - we've removed the 2 rows)   

The same logic applies for columns:
```{r}
# Create a new object called "anonymous_starwars2" and assign it 
# to the values which are the "starwars2" dataframe minus the 
# 1st column (the "name" column):
anonymous_starwars2 <- starwars2[, -1]

# print out anonymous_starwars2
anonymous_starwars2
```

# Refresher: Types of Data

In the dice-rolling example, each roll of the die could take one of a discrete set of responses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). A die cannot land on 5.3, or 2.6.  

There are many different things we can measure / record on observational units, and the data we collect will also have different characteristics. Some data will be similar to rolling a die in that values take on **categories**, and others could take any value on a **continuous** scale. We distinguish between these different types of data by talking about __categorical__ and __numerical__ variables. Within each, there also are a few important sub-classes.

:::yellow
__Categorical__ variables tell us what group or category each individual belongs to. Each distinct group or category is called a __level__ of the variable.
:::

|  __Type__ | __Description__ |  __Example__|
|:--|:--|:--|
|  __Nominal (Unordered categorical)__ | A categorical variable with _no_ intrinsic ordering among the levels. | Species: _Human_, _Droid_, _Wookie_, _Hutt_, ... |
|  __Ordinal (Ordered categorical)__ | A categorical variable which levels possess some kind of order |  Level: _Low_, _Medium_, _High_ |
|  __Binary categorical__ | A special case of categorical variable with only 2 possible levels |  Is_Human: _Yes_ or _No_. |

<br>

:::yellow
__Numerical__ (or quantitative) variables consist of numbers, and represent a measurable quantity. Operations like adding and averaging make sense only for numeric variables.
:::
|  __Type__ | __Description__ |  __Example__|
|:--|:--|:--|
|  __Continuous__ | Variables which can take any real number within the specified range of measurement |  Height: _172_, _165.2_, _183_, ... |
| __Discrete__ |  Variables which can only take integer number values. For instance, a _counts_ can only take positive integer values (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) | Number_of_siblings: _0_, _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, ... |
  

# Exercises: Categorical distributions  

For the exercises, we have a dataset on some of the most popular internet passwords, their strength, and how long it took for an algorithm to crack it.  
The data is available online at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/passworddata.csv.  
  
| Variable Name | Description            |
|---------------|--------------------|
| rank   | Popularity in the database of released passwords |
| password     | Password |
| type     | Category of password  |
| cracked     | Time to crack by online guessing |
| strength     | Strength = quality of password where 10 is highest, 1 is lowest |
| strength_cat     | Strength category (weak, medium, strong) |

create a frequency distribution table, and a frequency plot, of the password type variable. 


before, we ran code such as:
```{r eval=FALSE}
roll100 <- dice(100)
```
This created an object named "roll100" which was a **vector** - a set of values.  
What we are now working with is a dataframe, which is simply a list of vectors.  
Code which extracts a variable from a dataframe: `dataframe$variable` extracts it as a vector.

__Relative frequency distribution__

A relative frequency distribution shows the __proportion of times__ each value occurs  
(contrast this with the frequency distribution which shows the __number__ of times).  
Relative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or decimals.
:::

create the relative frequency distributon of the password type. You can do this by dividing the entire table by the sum of the table. R can calculate the sum using `sum()`

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(9, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We'll multiple the whole thing by 100 to make it percentages. 
```{r}
table(pwords$type)/sum(table(pwords$type))*100

barplot(table(pwords$type)/sum(table(pwords$type))*100)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(10)`
Create a new object in R which is only those passwords which are of the type "fluffy". 
  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(10, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
fluffy <- pwords[pwords$type=="fluffy", ]
```
`r solend()`


`r qbegin(11)`
note that the "strength" variable is categorical, but it is **ordered** (category 1 is the weakest, category 10 is the strongest).  

When categorical data is ordered, it is often useful to think about cumulative percentages

__Cumulative percentage__

Cumulative percentages are another way of expressing a frequency distribution.  
They are the __successive addition of percentages__ in each category. For example, the cumulative percentage for the 3rd category is the percentage of respondents in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd category:
```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  Category = paste0("Response ",1:5),
  n = c(10,10,20,25,10)
) %>% mutate(
  p = n/sum(n)*100,
  cn = cumsum(n),
  cp = cumsum(p)
) %>% rename(`Frequency count (n)`=n,
             `Relative frequency (%)`=p,
             `Cumulative frequency`=cn,
             `Cumulative percentage`=cp
             ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

**In R, we can cumulatively sum a set of numbers using the `cumsum()` function.**

At what password strength are 50% of the "fluffy" passwords on either side?  
**Hint:** how many "fluffy" passwords are there? make a relative frequency table, and use `cumsum()` to cumulatively sum these to work out where 50% lies. 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(11, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
# frequency table
freq <- table(fluffy$strength)
freq 

# relative frequency table
relfreq <- freq / sum(freq)
relfreq

# cumulative percentage
cumsum(relfreq)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(12)`
The point at which 50% of the data lies either side is the median (the mid-point of the data). Check your answer from the previous exercise by using the function `median()` on the strengths of the fluffy passwords.  
How does it compare to the median strength of passwords which are of type "simple-alphanumeric"? 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(12, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
median(fluffy$strength)

median(pwords$strength[pwords$type == "simple-alphanumeric"])
```

`r solend()`
