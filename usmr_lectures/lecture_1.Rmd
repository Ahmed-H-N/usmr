# Univariate Statistics...

```{r hdataH,include=FALSE}
load('R/heights.Rdata')
heights <- heights %>% mutate(gender = ifelse(gender=='Other','NonBinary',gender))
```

```{r hadata}
heights
```

- one row represents one set of observations
???
Univariate statistics refer to statistics where there's one source of variation.

Typically in Psychology this would be the identity of the person being measured:

In the example here, height is affected by identity (different people have different heights).

As statisticians, we're interested in whether there are systematic differences beyond the individual:

For example, is height affected by gender?

.pull-right[
### R

- basic programming
- using libraries
- using an IDE (**RStudio**)
- data types

As soon as we can, we'll offer discussions and help on campus.

We might be able to offer labs on campus as the situation changes, and we hope to do so.

Lectures are likely to remain online throughout the course.

- check a dataset for consistency

- explore hypotheses about how variables are related

- produce suitable graphics

- present your workings and conclusions in a markdown document

### About RMarkdown
_This_ is some **RMarkdown**, which uses 'simple' codes to mark up text.

- it can include R code like `r knitr::inline_expr("sqrt(2)")`
- it's simple to format things like bulleted lists
  + or even sublists
```

R is a multipurpose programming language with an emphasis on statistics.

It can do all of the things that any statistics package can do and much more:

Here, we're using it to visualise the frequencies with which words are used
in Jane Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_.

# The R Community

.left-column[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk('pp', 'svg')`)
]
.right-column[
- _someone else_ has done all the hard work to create wordclouds
- released as libraries or **packages** (like `lme4` and `tidyverse`)
- all I supplied was a text version of _Pride and Prejudice_

.pt3[
- **R** allows you to do _anything_ with data
- if it's useful, chances are someone has already done it
- useful things include statistics!
