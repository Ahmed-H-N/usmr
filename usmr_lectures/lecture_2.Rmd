# Problem is...

.pull-left[
- we don't have any way of measuring accurately enough

- our measurements are likely to be _close to_ the truth

- they might vary, if we measure more than once

# Measurement

.pull-left[
![:scale 70%](lecture_2_files/img/playmo_proft.svg)
]
.pull-right[
- we might _expect_ values close to the "true" measurement to be more frequent
- something like this:

.center[
```{r sketchnorm, echo=FALSE,fig.dim=c(3,3)}
t <- data.frame(x=rnorm(70,.076116,.0025))
t %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  xlim(0.06,0.09) +  
  geom_density() + scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=.076116,colour="red") +
  annotate(geom="text",colour="red",x=0.0785,y=25,label="TRUE MEASURE") +
  xlab('measurement') + ylab("") + theme_presentation(16)
```
]]

???
- so let's do a thought experiment and imagine what things
would look like if lots and lots of people tried to measure
the "true" distance of the notch from the end of the stick.

- most of them would be quite competent, and we would expect
the majority of the measurements to be close to the "true" value.

- every now and again, someone would overshoot or undershoot by rather
more.

- _theoretically_ they might be completely off-beam, although the chances of being way off get vanishingly small quite quickly.

# Something quite familiar

.center[
```{r normnorm,echo=F,fig.asp=0.55}
t <- data.frame(x=c(0.06,0.09))
t %>% ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n =151, args=list(mean=.076116,sd=.0025)) +
  ylab("") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .076116,colour="red") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  xlab("measurement")
```
]

???
- if we think a bit more about our thought experiment, we've actually described
something quite familiar:  A bell curve

- but what is a "bell curve"?

- to answer that question, let's start back where we were last week, with dice.
---
# Dice again

.center[
```{r dice, echo=FALSE,fig.asp=.6}
dice <- function(num=1) {
  sum(sample(1:6,num,replace = T))
}
t <- data.frame(x=replicate(1000,dice(3)))
t %>% ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=3:18,name = 'sum of dice',limits = c(2,19)) +
  ggtitle('1000 throws of 3 dice')

```
]

???
- to make it interesting, here's a plot of 1000 throws of 3 dice

- the height of the bars represent the numbers of times we obtain each value

- but why are the bars not touching each other?
---
# Dice throws aren't really numbers

.center[
```{r dice2, echo=FALSE,fig.asp=.6}
t %>% ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=3:18,labels = c('A','B','x','y','Fr','C','D','E','f','p','7','Q','#','u','v','w'),
  name = 'outcome type',limits = c(2,19)) +
  ggtitle('1000 throws of 3 dice')
```
]

???
- I could just label the possible outcomes of throwing three dice arbitrarily
  + I haven't chosen particularly sensible labels here, but you get the idea.

- if you think about it, there are only 16 possible values that the sum
  of three dice can take.
  
- and if the dice didn't have actual numbers on their faces, you could still
  enumerate the outcomes
  + A might be "three reds", B might be "a green and two reds",
  + x might be "two greens and a red, or a yellow and two reds", and so on.
  
- so the outcomes are _discrete_ (you can never throw a value between 3 and 4, or between "A and B")
- and the bars on a bar plot have gaps between them to show this.
---
# Height


???
- so sticking with the examples from last week, let's consider how we might represent a bunch of people's heights.
---
# Plan of attack

- barplots vs histograms

- sd?

### p2

- samples, populations

### p3

- CLT, standard deviation and standard error?
