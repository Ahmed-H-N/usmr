.pull-left[
- we don't have any way of measuring accurately enough

- our measurements are likely to be _close to_ the truth

# Measurement

.pull-left[
![:scale 70%](lecture_2_files/img/playmo_proft.svg)
]
.pull-right[
- we might _expect_ values close to the "true" measurement to be more frequent
- something like this:

.center[
```{r sketchnorm, echo=FALSE,fig.dim=c(3,3)}
stick <- data.frame(x=rnorm(70,.076116,.0025))
stick %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  xlim(0.06,0.09) +  
  geom_density() + scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=.076116,colour="red") +
  annotate(geom="text",colour="red",x=0.0785,y=25,label="TRUE MEASURE") +
  xlab('measurement') + ylab("") + theme_presentation(16)
```
]]

???
- so let's do a thought experiment and imagine what things
would look like if lots and lots of people tried to measure
the "true" distance of the notch from the end of the stick.

- most of them would be quite competent, and we would expect
the majority of the measurements to be close to the "true" value.

- every now and again, someone would overshoot or undershoot by rather
more.

- _theoretically_ they might be completely off-beam, although the chances of being way off get vanishingly small quite quickly.

# Something quite familiar

.center[
```{r normnorm,echo=F,fig.asp=0.55}
t <- data.frame(x=c(0.06,0.09))
t %>% ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n =151, args=list(mean=.076116,sd=.0025)) +
  ylab("") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .076116,colour="red") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  xlab("measurement")
```
]

???
- if we think a bit more about our thought experiment, we've actually described
something quite familiar:  A bell curve

- but what is a "bell curve"?

- to answer that question, let's start back where we were last week, with dice.
---
# Dice again

.center[
```{r dice, echo=FALSE,fig.asp=.6}
set.seed(13)
dice <- function(num=1) {
  sum(sample(1:6,num,replace = T))
}
t <- data.frame(x=replicate(1000,dice(2)))
t %>% ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=2:12,name = 'sum of dice',limits = c(1,13)) +
  ggtitle('1000 throws of 2 dice')

```
]

???
- the height of the bars represent the numbers of times we obtain each value

- but why are the bars not touching each other?
---
# Dice throws aren't really numbers

- **B** = ![:scale 20%](lecture_2_files/img/B1.svg) or ![:scale 20%](lecture_2_files/img/B2.svg)

- **C** = ![:scale 20%](lecture_2_files/img/C1.svg) or ![:scale 20%](lecture_2_files/img/C2.svg) or ![:scale 20%](lecture_2_files/img/C3.svg)

  name = 'outcome type',limits = c(1,13)) +
  ggtitle('1000 throws of 2 dice')
```
]]

.pt3[
- bar plot ("bar chart") always has gaps between bars
- represents frequencies of _discrete categories_ (`factors`)
]

???
- I could just label the possible outcomes of throwing two dice arbitrarily
  
- if you think about it, there are only 11 possible values that the sum
  of two dice can take.
  
- and if the dice didn't have actual numbers on their faces, you could still
  enumerate the outcomes

- so the outcomes are _discrete_ (you can never throw a value between 3 and 4, or between "B and C")
- and the bars on a bar plot have gaps between them to show this.

- easy to interpret ($y$-axis = counts)

- sometimes helpful in spotting weird data

# Density Plots

# Density Plots

.center[
```{r dense2, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=.6}
p + geom_rug()
```

- values are _interpolated_
- depends on a kernel (smoothing) function
---
# Density Plots

.center[
```{r dense3, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=.6,fig.width=6}
gp <- layer_data(p)
gp <- gp %>% filter(x>.0755 & x<.0765)
p + geom_area(data=gp, aes(x=x,y=y), fill="red") +
  geom_density(size=2)
```
]

- note that $y$ axis is no longer a count
- multiplied by a _range_ on the $x$ axis, gives **proportion** of cases (`r stick %>% filter(x >= .0755 & x <=.0765) %>% nrow() /70` )
- _total area_ under curve = "all possibilities" = **1**
???
- note that this isn't the whole curve, because the curve is **assymptotic**
  + tiny possibility that someone will say the distance is -1000 or 873

# A Famous Density Plot

- when we started thinking about measurement,
  we thought things might look a bit like this

- the so-called **normal curve**

  + a hypothetical density plot
]
.pull-right[
`r include_graphics("lecture_2_files/figure-html/normnorm-1.svg")`

]
???
- in part 3, we'll look at where the normal curve comes from

- for now, let's look at some of its features
---
# Normal Curves

.center[
```{r norms, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=.6,fig.width=6}
t <- data.frame(x=c(0.06,0.09))
p <- t %>% ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n =151, args=list(mean=.076116,sd=.0025)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n =151, args=list(mean=.076116,sd=.0035)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n =151, args=list(mean=.076116,sd=.001)) +
  ylab("") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .076116,colour="red") +
#  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  xlab("measurement")
p
```
]

- normal curves are centred about the **mean** (or "true measurement")
- the area under the (asymptotic) curve is always **1**
???
- the y value here is just what is needed to ensure that the area under the is 1
---
# Standard Deviation

.pull-left[
- normal curves can be defined in terms of _two parameters_

- one is the centre or **mean** of the distribution ( $\bar{x}$, or sometimes $\mu$ )

- the other is the **standard deviation** ( $\textrm{sd}$, or sometimes $\sigma$ )

$$\textrm{sd}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}$$

]
.pull-right[
```{r annotated, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=.6}
p +
  geom_segment(aes(x=0.0761, xend=0.0761+0.001, y=250, yend=250), col="red", size=1.5) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=0.0761, xend=0.0761+0.0025, y=100, yend=100), col="red", size=1.5) +
  geom_segment(aes(x=0.0761, xend=0.0761+0.0035, y=70, yend=70), col="red", size=1.5)
```
]

.pt3.pa2[
- standard deviation is the "average distance of observations from the mean"
]
---
# The Standard Normal Curve

.pull-left[
- we can **standardize** any value on any normal curve by

- subtracting the mean
  + the effective mean is now **zero**
  
- dividing by the standard deviation
  + the effective standard deviation is now **one**
]
.pull-right[
```{r snorm, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=.6}
p <- ggplot(data=data.frame(x=c(-3.5,3.5)),aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n =151,size=2) + ylab("") +
  xlab("standard deviations")
p
```

$$ z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{\sigma} $$

# Plan of attack

- barplots vs histograms

- sd?

### p2

- samples, populations

### p3

- CLT, standard deviation and standard error?
