# More about Height

.pull-left[
- last time we simulated the heights op a population of 10,000 people

- mean height ( $\bar{x}$ ) was 170; standard deviation ( $\sigma$ ) was 12.
  
```{r pop, fig.asp=.6}
curve(dnorm(x,170,12),from = 120, to = 220)
```

# How Unusual is Casper?


.pull-left[
- in his socks, Casper is 198 cm tall

- how likely would we be to find someone Casper's height in our population?
]
.pull-right[
```{r normvline,echo=FALSE, fig.asp=.6}
t <- tibble(x=c(120,220))
p <- t %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun=dnorm,n=151,args=list(mean=170,sd=12),size=1.5) +
  xlab("height") + ylab("density")
p + geom_vline(xintercept=198,colour="red")
```
]
???
- we can mark Casper's height on our normal curve
- but we can't do anything with this information
  + technically the line has "no width" so we can't calculate area
  + we need to reformulate the question

# How Unusual is Casper (Take 2)?

# How Unusual is Casper (Take 2)?

.pull-left[
- in his socks, Casper is 198 cm tall

- how likely would we be to find someone Casper's height _or more_ in our population?

- the area is `r (pp=pnorm(198,170,12,lower.tail=F))`

- so the probability of finding someone in the population of Casper's height or greater is `r pp` (or, $p=`r pp`$ )

# Tailedness

.pull-left[
- we kind of knew that Casper was _tall_
  + it made sense to ask what the likelihood of finding someone 198 cm _or greater_ was
    + this is called a **one-tailed hypothesis** (we're not expecting Casper to be well below average height!)
  
- often our hypothesis might be vaguer
  + we expect Casper to be "different", but we're not sure how
    + we can capture this using a **two-tailed hypothesis**
]
.pull-right[
```{r normtwo, echo=F,fig.asp=.6}
ld <- layer_data(p) %>% filter(x <= 142)
q + geom_area(data=ld,aes(x=x,y=y),fill="red") +
  stat_function(fun=dnorm,n=151,args=list(mean=170,sd=12),size=1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 170) + 
  annotate(geom="text",colour="red",x=175,y=.015,label="mean")

# Area under the Curve

- so now we know that the area under the curve can be used to quantify **probability**

- but how do we calculate area under the curve?

- luckily, R has us covered, using (in this case) the `pnorm()` function

- SOME R GOES HERE
